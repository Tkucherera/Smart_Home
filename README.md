# Smart_Home
## Using the following sensors to create a smart home
- humidity 
- temperature
- gas
- smoke
- water level 
- touch 
## Fuctionality 
- sensors will be connected to a raspberry pi with wifi
- the information from sensors is posted to a sql database in real time
- an android/ios application will then access this data
- the application will have a user friendly UI to show the user data from the home in real time 
## Update 
I have 3 sensors conected a temp/Humidity, Motion and Water level sensor 
All 3 capture data and store it to a relational database (MYsql) 
I have written a php script that get the data from MYsql and display it in 
a nice looking website
